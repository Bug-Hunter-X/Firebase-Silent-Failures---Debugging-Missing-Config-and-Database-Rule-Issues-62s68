To solve the firebaseConfig issue, double-check your `firebase.initializeApp()` call to ensure the `firebaseConfig` object contains all required parameters.  For database rule problems, carefully review your database rules in the Firebase console.  Make sure they allow the required read/write operations.  For more complex scenarios, use Firebase's Emulator Suite for local testing and debugging.
