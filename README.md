# Firebase Silent Failures: Debugging Missing Config and Database Rule Issues

This repository demonstrates two uncommon Firebase errors that can be difficult to debug:

1. **Missing or Incorrect Firebase Configuration:** The Firebase SDK might not throw explicit errors if your `firebaseConfig` object is missing essential parameters (e.g., `apiKey`, `authDomain`, `projectId`). Instead, operations might fail silently.
2. **Overly Restrictive Database Rules:** Incorrectly configured database rules can prevent data access without providing clear error messages to the client.

The `firebaseBug.js` file shows examples of these problems, while `firebaseBugSolution.js` demonstrates how to solve them.
