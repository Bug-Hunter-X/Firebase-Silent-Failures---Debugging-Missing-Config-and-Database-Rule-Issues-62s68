The Firebase SDK might throw an error if the provided configuration is invalid or incomplete.  For example, missing `apiKey`, `authDomain`, `projectId`, etc. in your `firebaseConfig` object will cause authentication and other Firebase services to fail silently.  Another issue could be incorrect database rules leading to unexpected permission errors.  These errors aren't always easily debuggable because they may not result in clear, helpful error messages.
